# invoice-table-detection-and-text-extraction
This program aims to detect tables/invoices from an image using an object-detection-YOLOv4-model and subsequently extract the available text-information by employing an OCR.

I worked on creating this program during a Hackathon conducted by IIT Madras.

The model is fine-tuned on a dataset using a dataset containing n? images.
The dataset was split into training and validation.
See notebook.ipynb for a complete code to train the model.
